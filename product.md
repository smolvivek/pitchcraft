# Product Definition (Working Title: TBD)

## Product Name (Working)
(To be decided. Name will be locked after MVP validation.)

(Product intent must not change.)

## What Pitchcraft Is

Pitchcraft is a presentation and funding platform for creative professionals (filmmakers, writers, ad creators, content creators) that helps them:

- structure creative work clearly
- present ideas to collaborators, funders, and producers
- raise money through a professional funding link
- evolve projects across versions over time

Pitchcraft is **not** a pitch deck generator, not an AI writing tool, and not a marketplace.

It is a system for making creative work intelligible without flattening the creator's intent.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Manual-first, AI-optional.**

- Creators control everything they enter
- AI assists only when explicitly invited
- AI suggests completions, summarizes text, generates reference images
- AI never overwrites creator intent
- All AI assistance is reversible and transparent

Creators may fill all fields comprehensively or be selective about what they share. Every field is optional except the 8 required fields.

---

## Product Universe

Pitchcraft exists as a standalone product.

**Future:** A companion writing tool may exist in the same universe (Phase 2+), but is not part of MVP. Pitchcraft works without it.

---

## The Pitch (Core Artifact)

Every project produces a single shareable link.

The link represents a specific version of the project and may be:
- Public
- Private (invite-only)
- Password-protected

The pitch includes:
- All 8 required fields (see below)
- Optional production sections the creator selects
- Media assets (images, video references, generated content)
- Funding integration (optional)
- Version history (persistent)

---

## Required Fields (8)

Every pitch must include these eight fields. They form the skeleton of every pitch, regardless of creator type or project format.

These eight fields work universally for filmmakers, game developers, photographers, animators, advertisers, and any other creative.

### 1. **Logline**
- One-sentence pitch
- The core idea distilled to its essence
- Required field

### 2. **Synopsis**
- 2–5 paragraph story or concept summary

- Required field

### 3. **Genre & Format**

- Required field

### 5. **Cast & Characters**

## Optional Production Sections

Creators select which sections to include. Each section is optional. Creators choose what's relevant to their project.

A single interface works for all creator types. A filmmaker adds "Cast & Characters." A game dev adds "Game Mechanics." A photographer adds "Portfolio & Previous Work." The tool doesn't change—only the sections they fill.

### **Flow (Optional, Prominently Featured)**

The Flow is a horizontal-scroll experience showing the emotional, narrative, or visual arc of the project.

**What it is:**
- Immersive storytelling tool (not a pitch deck slide)
- Created by the filmmaker/creator to feel their project
- Sequence of beats showing the journey of the work

**How creators build it:**
- Upload images in sequence (5–10 beats recommended, no hard limit)
- Add video links to any beat (embedded previews)
- Add character arc labels ("Hero doubt," "Turning point," "Resolution")
- Add optional audio track (voiceover, music, ambient sound)
- Add brief captions per beat (2–3 words)

**How viewers experience it:**
- Horizontal scroll through beats
- Full-bleed images, minimal UI (arrows to scroll)
- Character arc labels and captions visible
- Audio plays as they scroll (if creator added it)
- Feels like experiencing the project, not consuming information

**Image limits:** 5 images max per beat

**Why it matters:**
- Creators control the flow (not algorithm-generated)
- It's a storytelling tool, not a presentation tool
- Differentiates from competitors

---

### **Companion Documents**

One optional document upload (script, design doc, treatment, design bible, etc.).

**What it is:**
- PDF or document (any format creator chooses)
- Uploaded by creator, preview available in pitch link
- Does not require parsing or integration
- Commonly used for: Final Draft/Celtx scripts, design docs, treatments, lookbooks

**Why it matters:**
- No need to manage multiple links

---

## Versions & Persistence

Pitchcraft assumes real creative timelines:
- Weeks or months between reviews
- Stakeholders joining late
- Feedback and evolution over time

Therefore:
- All versions persist
- Feedback (Phase 2+) carries forward meaningfully
- Creators see what changed and why
- Pitchcraft becomes more valuable over time as project evolves

---

## Access & Sharing

Creators control exactly who sees their pitch:

### **Public**
- Anyone with link can view
- Searchable (optional, Phase 2+)

### **Private (Invite-Only)**
- Creator sends link to specific people
- Not searchable
- View-only access

### **Password-Protected**
- Public link requires password
- Useful for sensitive projects or controlled distribution

---

## AI in Pitchcraft

AI assists, never dictates.

### What AI Can Do:
- Suggest field completion ("You haven't filled Cinematography—want suggestions?")
- Summarize dense text into concise pitches
- Generate reference images (optional, paid)
- Expand or condense written descriptions
- Surface missing sections based on project type

### What AI Cannot Do:
- Overwrite creator content
- Auto-fix or "improve" creative work
- Judge or score projects
- Enforce "best practices" or templates
- Act without explicit creator consent

### Always Transparent:
- AI suggestions clearly labeled
- Creators can accept, reject, or edit
- All changes are reversible
- No silent processing or hidden changes

---

## Users & Personas

### Primary Users
- Filmmakers (indie, experimental, documentary)
- Writers pitching adaptations or original work
- Ad creatives pitching campaigns
- Content creators (YouTube, streaming)
- Photographers pitching projects
- Anyone with creative work seeking feedback or funding

### Secondary Users (Phase 2+)

Creators remain the priority. All features serve creator intent first.

---

## Design Philosophy

### Influences:
- **Dieter Rams:** Restraint, clarity, honesty, function without decoration
- **Teenage Engineering:** Playful precision, delightful interaction, attention to detail
- **Apple:** Intuitive, invisible complexity, calm aesthetic

### Rules:
- No loud UI
- No novelty for novelty's sake
- Animations must be intentional and calm
- Light mode only (MVP)
- One strong accent color (owned, not copied)
- Grid-based, consistent spacing
- Typography: 3 fonts (heading, body, metadata monospace)
- Clarity over cleverness

---

## Non-Goals

Pitchcraft is **not:**
- A social network
- A marketplace (no creator discovery, no ranking)
- A script judging algorithm

- A collaboration platform (Phase 2+)

Pitchcraft does **not:**
- Rank projects or creators
- Tell creators what to make
- Optimize creativity into sameness
- Silently track usage or behavior
- Generate ideas for creators
- Enforce narrative structure or formulas

---

## Security & Trust

- Explicit access control (public/private/password)
- Permissioned links only

- No surprise automation
- Creator retains full ownership of content

Trust is a core feature.

## Final Principle

Pitchcraft exists to make creative work intelligible without flattening it.

If a feature violates this principle, it does not ship.

Creators are in control. Always.
