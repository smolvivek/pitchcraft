## Key Rules

1. **Audience is inclusive** — producers, clients, collaborators, anyone. Never narrow to "producers" only.
2. The word "Version" (not "Evolve") for the third pillar.
3. CTA is "Create your first project" (not "Start").
4. Bottom metadata is "Build · Share · Version" (not "Presentation · Funding · Versioning").
