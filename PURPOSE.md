# PURPOSE.md — Why This Product Exists

(Working title: TBD. Name will be finalized after MVP validation.)

## The Problem

Creative professionals—filmmakers, writers, ad creators—face a consistent, painful problem:

**Pitching creative work is broken.**

Right now, here's what happens:

1. A filmmaker finishes a script for a short film or feature.
2. They want to pitch it to producers, funders, or collaborators.
3. They open a generic presentation tool.
4. They build a deck: title slide, synopsis, some reference images, maybe a budget.
5. They send it via email.
6. Feedback comes back via messaging apps, email threads, voice memos — scattered, vague, hard to act on.
7. They update the deck. Send again. Feedback again. Chaos.
8. If they want to raise money, they either use a generic crowdfunding platform (not built for creatives) or email fundraising pages individually.
9. There's no single source of truth. No version history. No way to see "what changed and why."

The result: **Creative pitches are messy, unstructured, and frustrating.**

Worse: Existing tools treat all pitches the same way. They optimize for *perfect slides*, not *clear communication of creative intent*. They flatten unique visions into templates.

## What Pitchcraft Solves

Pitchcraft is the first tool built specifically for creative pitching. It:

1. **Structures creative work without flattening it**
   - 8 required fields ensure clarity
   - 10+ optional sections let creators add what matters to them
   - No templates. No enforced formulas.

2. **Makes feedback legible**
   - One source of truth (the pitch link)
   - Version history (who saw what, when)
   - All feedback in one place (Phase 2)
   - No more scattered emails/messages

3. **Enables funding without leaving the platform**
   - Creators can ask for support directly in the pitch
   - Stripe/Patreon integration handles money
   - Pitchcraft takes commission, creators keep the rest
   - Professional, transparent, credible

4. **Respects creative control**
   - Creators decide what to share
   - AI assists, never overwrites
   - Manual-first, AI-optional
   - No hidden optimizations or ranking

## Who We Serve

**Primary:** Creative professionals with 5+ years of experience who know what they want to make.

They are:
- Indie filmmakers with scripts ready to fund
- Ad creatives pitching campaigns
- Documentary filmmakers seeking production partners
- Writers pitching adaptations or original projects
- Content creators (YouTube, Vimeo, streaming) seeking collaboration or funding

They are **not** beginners needing hand-holding. They are professionals needing infrastructure.

**Secondary (Phase 2+):** The people who evaluate pitches.
- Producers assessing projects
- Funders and investors
- Studios optioning IP
- Festivals reviewing submissions

But creators come first. Every feature serves creator intent.

## Success Metrics (What "Done" Looks Like)

### For Creators:
- Can build a comprehensive, professional pitch in under 30 minutes
- Can share one link instead of juggling emails, PDFs, and presentation decks
- Can raise money through the platform without external tools
- Can see version history and understand what changed
- Feel confident showing their pitch to producers, funders, collaborators

### For Pitchcraft:
- Creators come back to update pitches as projects evolve
- Creators use "Support this Project" to raise real money
- Commission revenue from successful fundraising
- Creators recommend Pitchcraft to other creators
- Becomes the default standard for creative pitch presentation (in indie/professional circles)

### For the Market:
- No existing tool does what Pitchcraft does
- Fill the gap between generic presentation software and industry-specific platforms
- Build a moat through *trust* (creators own their data, control their presentation)

## What Pitchcraft Is NOT

Pitchcraft is **not** a replacement for:
- Screenwriting software
- Shooting schedule software
- Budget management tools
- Collaboration platforms
- Pitch deck generators or generic presentation tools

Pitchcraft is **specifically** a presentation + funding + versioning tool for creative work.

It lives *downstream* of script development and *upstream* of production planning.

## The Competitive Advantage

**Why Pitchcraft wins:**

1. **Built for creatives, not generic users**
   - Understands production vocabulary
   - Respects creative autonomy
   - Designed with 20+ years of creative experience

2. **Manual-first philosophy**
   - Creators decide what to share
   - No algorithmic flattening
   - No AI-generated "better" versions of their work

3. **Funding integrated, not bolted on**
   - Money happens in the pitch, not in a separate platform
   - Stripe/Patreon integration is transparent
   - Creators keep most of what they raise

4. **Version control as core feature**
   - Every pitch version persists
   - Feedback carries forward (Phase 2)
   - Clear history of evolution
   - Becomes more valuable over time

5. **No surveillance, no ranking**
   - Creators aren't ranked or scored
   - No analytics feeding algorithms
   - Trust is the business model, not engagement metrics

## The Worldview

Pitchcraft represents a specific worldview about creative work:

- **Creators should control their presentation.** Not algorithms, not templates, not "best practices." The creator decides.
- **Structure clarifies, it doesn't constrain.** The 8 requireds ensure every pitch is intelligible. Everything else is optional.
- **AI assists, it doesn't replace.** Suggestions, summaries, reference images—but never overwrites creative intent.
- **Funding should be professional and transparent.** No sketchy equity, no hidden fees, no mystery. Stripe/Patreon, clear commission, done.
- **Creative work deserves a credible home.** Not a social network obsessed with engagement. Not a marketplace ranking projects. A quiet, focused tool that does one thing well.

---

## Long-Term Vision (Not in MVP)

In Phase 2 and beyond, Pitchcraft could evolve into:
- A feedback system where producers/funders comment directly on sections
- Integration with writing tools for seamless pitch building
- Light creator networking (not social, but functional)
- Workflow automation for collaborative pitching
- Distribution/festival submission integration

But Phase 1 is ruthlessly focused: **Presentation + Funding + Versioning. That's it.**

## Success Looks Like This

A filmmaker pitches a short film.

They build the pitch in Pitchcraft in 20 minutes:
- Logline, synopsis, vision, cast, budget, production status, team
- Add locations, costumes, stunts (relevant sections)
- Upload reference images
- Set budget range: $50K–$100K
- Enable "Support this Project": $75K goal

They share one link to producers and their community.

Producers see a professional, structured pitch.

Their community can fund the film directly through the link.

They update to v2 (new cast attached). v1 is still there. Anyone can see the evolution.

Feedback comes through later (Phase 2). All in one place.

The film gets made. They update the pitch with behind-the-scenes photos, production timeline, finished trailer.

Six months later, they start a new project. They already trust Pitchcraft. They build the next pitch in 15 minutes.

**That's success.**

## Final Principle

Pitchcraft exists because creative professionals deserve better infrastructure.

Not to optimize creativity. Not to rank creators. Not to extract data.

Just to make it easier for creators to be understood and funded.
