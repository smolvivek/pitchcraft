## Direct Competitors (Film/Creative-Specific)

| Tool | What It Does | Pricing | Visual Quality | Threat |
|------|-------------|---------|----------------|--------|
| **NuPitch** | Mobile-first film pitch decks (closed beta) | TBD | Unknown (beta) | Moderate |
| **LTX Studio** | AI-generated pitch decks/storyboards | $12–125/mo | Polished (Lightricks-backed) | Low-Mod |
| **Slated** | Film packaging + investor matching | $495+ per analysis | Dated finance-terminal look | Low |
| **Seed&Spark** | Film crowdfunding (75% success rate) | 5% of funded amount | Clean but generic startup | Low-Mod |
| **Stage 32** | Social network + paid pitch sessions | Per-session pricing | 2012-era LinkedIn clone | Very Low |
| **InkTip** | Script listing service (20+ years, 400+ films) | $32.50/mo | Looks like 2005 | Very Low |
| **Saga** | AI screenwriting + secondary pitch deck feature | $19.99/mo | Modern app, writing-focused | Low |
| **Coverfly** | Was: free writer-to-industry platform | — | **Shut down Aug 2025** | — |
| **The Film Deck** | Consulting service for custom pitch decks | $500–2000+ | High (human-designed) | Very Low |

### Key Observations

- **NuPitch** is the closest direct competitor conceptually but unproven and early
- **Slated** has real investor connections but algorithmically scores creative work (anti-PitchCraft philosophy)
- **Seed&Spark** handles funding well but campaigns are temporary, not permanent links
- **Coverfly shutting down** left a gap in free writer-to-industry tools
- **Every direct competitor** handles only one piece (presentation OR funding OR connections), never all three

## Adjacent Competitors (General Tools Filmmakers Use Today)

| Tool | Users | Pricing | Threat | Why Filmmakers Use It | Why It Fails Them |
|------|-------|---------|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Notion** | 100M+ | Free–$18/mo | HIGH | Flexible, free, already in workflows | Looks like a document, not a premiere |
| **Canva** | 170M+ | Free–$14.99/mo | MOD-HIGH | Accessible, has ShotDeck integration | Output screams "free template." VCs recognize Canva decks |
| **Gamma** | 70M+ | Free–$15/mo | Moderate | Fast AI generation | Generic, no film awareness, light/corporate aesthetic |
| **Pitch.com** | — | Free–$22/mo | Moderate | Analytics + passcode links | No film-specific structure |
| **Beautiful.ai** | — | $12–40/mo | Low | Auto-formatted slides | Too corporate. Filmmakers' visions don't survive auto-formatting |
| **Google Slides** | Universal | Free | Moderate | Everyone has it | No one has ever been excited to receive a Google Slides film pitch |

### Displacement Priority

1. **Notion** — the biggest threat because it's free, flexible, and already embedded in filmmaker workflows
2. **Canva** — the current default for visual pitch decks. Must be dramatically better at the specific job
3. **Gamma** — growing fast but generic. PitchCraft wins by being purpose-built

## The Gap Matrix

No single tool combines all three:

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## Six Structural Gaps PitchCraft Fills

### 1. No Tool Combines Presentation + Funding + Versioning
Every competitor handles one piece. PitchCraft integrates all three in a single product.

### 2. Visual Quality — Most Filmmaker Tools Look Like 2015 SaaS
InkTip (2005), Stage 32 (2012), Slated (finance terminal), Seed&Spark (generic white startup). These are tools for visual storytellers that look worse than the work they represent. PitchCraft's A24 dark aesthetic is the first filmmaker tool that matches the quality of the films it serves.

### 3. The "One Link" Problem
Filmmakers currently assemble pitches across 4–6 tools: synopsis in Google Docs, mood boards in Canva, budget in Excel, deck in Keynote, bios on LinkedIn, funding on Kickstarter. Then they email PDFs or paste multiple links. No single URL represents a complete pitch.

### 4. Version Control for Pitches Does Not Exist
Filmmakers end up with "PitchDeck_v3_FINAL_REAL_v2.pdf." No tool in this space offers meaningful version history for evolving creative work.

### 5. Trust and Privacy
Filmmakers are increasingly anxious about tools scanning uploaded content for AI training. Some companies "quietly change their terms of service to give themselves full access to project materials." PitchCraft's stance (no analytics, no surveillance, no AI training on content, creator owns everything) is a genuine differentiator.

### 6. Template Fatigue
VCs and industry professionals recognize Canva templates and Gamma outputs. PitchCraft's single opinionated aesthetic (no template gallery) means every pitch looks premium by default.

## Pricing Landscape

| Competitor | Price | What You Get |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Canva Pro | $12.99/mo | Generic design tool |
| Gamma Pro | $15/mo | AI presentations |
| Pitch.com Pro | $8/mo | Presentations + analytics |
| Beautiful.ai Pro | $12/mo | Smart slides |
| InkTip Pro | $32.50/mo | Script listing |
| Saga Premium | $19.99/mo | AI screenwriting |
| LTX Studio Standard | $28–35/mo | AI filmmaking |
| Papermark Pro | $24/mo | Secure document sharing |
| Slated Analysis | $495 one-time | Script/financial analysis |

### PitchCraft Pricing Opportunity

A filmmaker currently paying Canva ($13) + Papermark ($24) + time assembling = $37+/month in tools and effort. PitchCraft replaces all of it.

- **Free tier:** 1 pitch, basic features, PitchCraft branding on shared link
- **Pro tier ($15–20/mo):** Unlimited pitches, password protection, funding integration, version history, no branding

## Positioning

**One sentence:** PitchCraft is the only tool where a filmmaker can present, fund, and version their creative vision through a single, beautiful, shareable link.

**Why a filmmaker would choose PitchCraft over a Notion page:**
1. It looks cinematic — sending a PitchCraft link says "I take my work seriously"
2. It is structured for their exact workflow — logline, synopsis, vision, cast, budget, team
3. It is one living link, not a dead PDF attachment
4. Funding is built in — no separate Kickstarter campaign
5. It respects their IP — no tracking, no AI training on their content
6. Version history gives them a creative record
