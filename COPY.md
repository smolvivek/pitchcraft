# COPY.md — Site Copy & Voice

All copy for PitchCraft, organized by page and context.

---

## Voice Principles

**Influences:**
- **A24:** Bold, confident, no hand-holding. "Moonlight" not "Your film journey starts here!"
- **Teenage Engineering:** Terse, precise, monospace. "BPM 120" not "Set your tempo"
- **Dieter Rams:** Honest, functional, no decoration. "Delete project" not "Are you absolutely sure?"

**Core rules:**
- Direct. No fluff.
- Filmmaker language, not SaaS speak.
- Confident but not cocky.
- Warm but not casual.
- Short sentences. Get to the point.

**Never:**
- Exclamation marks (except critical errors)
- Emoji
- Marketing speak ("game-changer", "seamless", "revolutionary")
- Apologizing ("Oops!", "Sorry about that!")
- Corporate jargon ("leverage", "utilize", "synergy")

## Landing Page

### Hero Section

```

**Body:**
```
Logline, synopsis, vision, budget, team.
Flow, locations, camera, sound design, crew.
Everything a producer, funder, or collaborator needs to say yes.

No templates. No AI writing your pitch.
Your work, your voice, your control.
```

---

### Section 3: How It Works

**Heading:**
```
Build it once. Share it forever.
```

**Steps:**
```
1. Fill 8 required fields

Every pitch lives at its own URL.
Update it. Version it. Track who sees it.
No middleman. No marketplace. Just your work.
```

### Section 4: Who It's For

**Heading:**
```
Built for creators, not platforms.

## Signature Animations

### 1. Scroll-Driven Landing Page

The landing page is a sequence, not a static page. Scroll IS the film reel advancing.

- Three headline lines clip-reveal horizontally as the user scrolls
- Each landing section enters through scroll position (content transforms, not just "appears")
- Typography is the visual element — large-scale type moves with cinematic intention
- No floating shapes, no decorative elements

### 2. Section Transition — A24 Title Card

The defining animation of the product. Every section change in create/edit:

- Current content drops to opacity 0 (150ms)
- Section number appears large (72px monospace), centered, holds for 350ms
- Number fades as new content fades in (300ms)
- Total: ~1s. Patient but not slow.

---

## Micro-Interaction Moments

**1. Section Completion**
- Section number shifts to pop colour (`#AF2E1B`), 200ms ease-out
- Tick mark appears instantly — no drawn animation
- Like a hardware toggle clicking into position

**2. Character Counter Roll**
- Digits roll like odometer as you type (staggered 30ms per column)
- Colour shifts to `#AF2E1B` at 80% limit — instant, like a warning light
- Red (`#D32F2F`) when over limit — instant

**3. Save / Create Success**
- Button text swaps to "Saved" or "Created" — instant, no animation
- Reverts after 1.2s
- No fade to black, no glow pulse. The absence of fanfare IS the design.

**4. Budget Segment Selection**
- Selected segment fills with `#AF2E1B`, text goes white. 150ms ease-out.
- Previous segment returns to neutral simultaneously
- One on, one off. Like radio presets on a Braun receiver.

**5. Status Radio Selection**
- Dot appears at full size, color fills instantly
- Card border shifts to status color (200ms ease-out)
- No spring. No glow.

**6. Cast/Team Member Add**
- New card appears at full size. Opacity 0 → 1, 150ms ease-out.
- First input auto-focuses — the focus ring IS the attention signal

**7. Progress Bar Fill**
- Ease-out fill, no overshoot. 400ms. Precision is the point.
- At 8/8: bar and label shift to success colour. No pulse.

**8. Button Press**
- Scale to 0.98x on press, immediate. Returns to 1.0 on release (100ms ease-out).
- Like pressing a physical key.

**9. Modal**
- Backdrop dims 40% black, no blur
- Modal appears at full size, opacity 0 → 1, 200ms ease-out. No scale.

## Implementation Notes

- All copy in this file is **final and approved**
- Developers should copy verbatim, not paraphrase
- Any deviation from this voice requires updating this document first
- When adding new features, reference this file for tone and style
- Copy is part of the design system—consistency matters

---

## Final Principle

**Good copy is invisible.**

If the user notices the writing, we've failed. The words should guide, clarify, and get out of the way. Only the creator's work should be visible.

Restrain. Clarify. Respect.
