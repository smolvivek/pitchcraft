# COPY.md — Site Copy & Voice

All copy for PitchCraft, organized by page and context.

---

## Voice Principles

**Influences:**
- **A24:** Bold, confident, no hand-holding. "Moonlight" not "Your film journey starts here!"
- **Teenage Engineering:** Terse, precise, monospace. "BPM 120" not "Set your tempo"
- **Dieter Rams:** Honest, functional, no decoration. "Delete pitch" not "Are you absolutely sure?"

**Core rules:**
- Direct. No fluff.
- Filmmaker language, not SaaS speak.
- Confident but not cocky.
- Warm but not casual.
- Short sentences. Get to the point.

**Never:**
- Exclamation marks (except critical errors)
- Emoji
- Marketing speak ("game-changer", "seamless", "revolutionary")
- Apologizing ("Oops!", "Sorry about that!")
- Corporate jargon ("leverage", "utilize", "synergy")

## Strategic Animation Moments

### Where Animations Bring Life

**1. Section Completion**
- Checkmark draws over section number in sidebar (300ms SVG animation)
- Audible click if sound enabled
- Progress bar jumps with spring overshoot

**2. Section Transition**
- Current content cuts to black
- New section number appears centered in large monospace
- Number fades out, new content fades in (A24-style title card)

**3. Character Counter Roll**
- Digits roll like odometer as you type
- Color shifts to terracotta at 80% limit
- Red when over limit

**4. Empty State Illustration**
- Simple line drawing (film strip/clapperboard) draws itself on page load
- Minimal, Rams-style, 3-4 lines max

**5. Create Pitch Success**
- Button text fades, checkmark draws inside button
- Screen fades to black, dashboard fades in
- New pitch card has subtle glow pulse (1 cycle, 600ms)

**6. Loading During Save**
- Progress bar below button fills with terracotta
- Spring overshoot at end
- Or: Simple line illustration draws/undraws in loop

**7. Budget Segment Selection**
- Clicked segment scales to 102%
- Terracotta fill slides in left-to-right (150ms)
- Previously selected drains out right-to-left

**8. Status Radio Selection**
- Colored dot scales from 0 to 1.2x (spring overshoot)
- Settles to 1.0x
- Card border glows terracotta briefly (300ms)

**9. Cast/Team Member Add**
- New card slides down from collapsed (200ms)
- Scales 95% to 100% (spring)
- First input auto-focuses
- Subtle terracotta left border glow (1 second)

**10. Progress Bar Fill**
- Bar extends with 5% overshoot when section completes
- Springs back to correct percentage (150ms bounce)
- Pulses green when 8/8 complete (400ms)

## Strategic Visual Moments

### Where Visuals Support Text-Heavy UI

**1. Dashboard Empty State**
- Simple line illustration (film strip or clapperboard)
- Draws itself on page load (stroke animation, 800ms)
- Monochrome, minimal, on-brand

**2. Create Pitch Welcome (Optional)**
- First-time users see subtle visual guide
- Simple diagram showing 8 required sections
- Fades after first visit

**3. Section Icons in Sidebar (Optional)**
- Minimal monochrome icons next to section numbers
- Camera icon for Camera & Cinematography, etc.
- Very subtle, not decorative

**4. Loading State Visual**
- Simple geometric pattern that animates during save
- Not a spinner—branded pattern (film strip, grid, etc.)
- Monochrome, minimal motion

**5. Success Confirmation Visual**
- Checkmark draw animation (already planned)
- Or: Simple terracotta pulse around button

**6. Error State Visual (Critical Errors Only)**
- Red X or warning triangle draws itself
- Used sparingly—most errors are inline text only

## Implementation Notes

- All copy in this file is **final and approved**
- Developers should copy verbatim, not paraphrase
- Any deviation from this voice requires updating this document first
- When adding new features, reference this file for tone and style
- Copy is part of the design system—consistency matters

---

## Final Principle

**Good copy is invisible.**

If the user notices the writing, we've failed. The words should guide, clarify, and get out of the way. Only the creator's work should be visible.

Restrain. Clarify. Respect.
